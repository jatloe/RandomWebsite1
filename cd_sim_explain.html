    <h1>How the CDR Simulator Works</h1>
    <p>The CDR Simulator starts with a set of hand-picked problems picked by mathemolympiad and jatloe.</p>
    <p>This simulator works like Countdown Round, except you can buzz by pressing 'b' or clicking the Buzz button.</p>
    <p>Players get a random set of five problems each time they play. When they finish, they get a code.</p>
    <p>This code is the JSON data of the game, and can be sent to other people.</p>
    <p>The other people use the Import Opponent button to import the JSON code, then plays against it.</p>
    <p>This simulator assumes that if a person gets a problem wrong, the other person gets it right, as they do not have time pressure anymore.</p>
    <p>Want to pick/contribute problems? DM jatloe12345#8718 on Discord to do so. Contributors get a special role in the Discord server.</p>
