        <p>Fill in the grid with digits from 0 to 9 to form all of the targets.</p>
        <p>You may leave a cell blank, but you cannot form a target "through" a blank.</p>
        <p>In "proper" puzzles, all targets will be three-digit perfect squares.</p>
        <p>Note that puzzles do not need to have unique solutions.</p>
